ToDo List
1. Interface:
a) Header: Logo + Log In / Log Out / Register
b) Sidebar: all of the lists created by the user - when user presses the button, list opens.
c) List window
- Title of the list + date
- Input line (for task) + Submit button (could we do without button just pressing Enter?)
- List of tasks checkmarks + we need functionality which crosses the taks when user presses checkmark
- Delete button for each task
- Tag button - for tagging each task with different colors
d) Footer - name, year, copyright sign
